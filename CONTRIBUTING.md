# Contributor Agreement Policy

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in working with us. Our project is breaking new ground in technology and business and we're glad that you want to come along for the ride. Our work involves cutting edge cryptography and large amounts of money so you'll probably find that our contribution policies are a little more stringent then some other's that you've worked with in the past. But don't panic it's all sensible and low-overhead... just careful.

Please note that we are a **very** international team so when you are communicating with us please try to be clear and avoid references that we won't understand (like obscure metaphores, references to local sports teams etc.)

## Contacting Us

If you would like to contribute to this repository we'll need to send you an invitiation. You can let us know you'd like to join by submitting some details via our [our community portal](https://community.qredo.org/)

## Issues, Features and Requests

### Questions
Please don't create an issue to ask a question - the [community portal](https://community.qredo.org/) is the place to do that

### Suggestions
If you have an idea for a feature or an improvement to Qredo discuss it on the community portal first and if it gets the thumbs up from the rest of the team go ahead and raise it as an issue. We like the Cucumber BDD style similar to this

```
GIVEN THAT: A suggestion is submitted
    AND: It has been reviewed and agreed in the Community portal
    THEN: Go ahead and raise a ticket
    AND: Drink a cold one
```

### Bugs
If you have found a bug go-ahead and raise an issue but make sure that you include the steps to reproduce it and label it as a bug

## Contributing Code 

We are following a gitflow process, [it is described in detail here](https://github.com/qredo/Qredo-Crypto-Library/wiki/VERSION-CONTROL)

### Features

If you want to develop a new feature fork from development, then merge back into Development. One of the core team will create a release branch to promote your code to master

### Hotfixes

Fork from Master and submit a PR
